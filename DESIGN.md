# Redis Stream-Based Key Expiration Handler

## Goal
Create a highly scalable and reliable system to process Redis key expiration events using Redis Streams and consumer groups, ensuring:
- Exactly-once processing semantics
- Even load distribution across multiple consumers
- High throughput with minimal latency
- Resilience against race conditions and message duplication

## System Design

### Architecture Components

1. **Redis Server**
   - Handles key storage and expiration
   - Provides keyspace notifications for expired events
   - Manages streams and consumer groups

2. **Key Generator**
   - Simulates workload by creating keys with expiration
   - Monitors unexpired key count
   - Controls key creation rate

3. **Stream Processor**
   - Uses Redis Streams for reliable event delivery
   - Implements consumer group pattern for load balancing
   - Ensures exactly-once processing with distributed locking

### Key Features

1. **Exactly-Once Processing**
   - Distributed locking with unique message-based lock keys
   - Double-check mechanism to prevent race conditions
   - Atomic operations using Redis pipelines
   - Tracking of processed keys in a Redis Set

2. **Consumer Group Management**
   - Dynamic load balancing across consumers
   - Exponential backoff for error handling
   - Proper message acknowledgment timing
   - Efficient message claiming for failed consumers

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimal lock duration (500ms)
   - Short processing time per key (5ms)
   - Controlled key creation rate
   - Optimized consumer block times

### Implementation Details

1. **Key Processing Flow**
   ```
   Key Expiration → Redis Notification → Stream Event → Consumer Group → Processing
   ```

2. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - Unique lock keys per message
   - Double validation of processed status
   - Atomic operations for state changes
   - Deferred lock cleanup

3. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Per-consumer statistics
   - Duplicate and skip counting
   - Maximum unexpired keys tracking

## Performance Results

### Test Configuration
- Total Keys: 3,000,000
- Number of Consumers: 64
- Key Expiration Time: 100ms
- Key Creation Delay: 100µs

### Results

1. **Processing Statistics**
   - Total Keys Processed: 3,000,000
   - Processing Rate: 1,284 keys/second
   - Maximum Unexpired Keys: 491
   - Duplicate Attempts: 0
   - Skipped Keys: 0

2. **Load Distribution**
   - Average Keys per Consumer: 46,875
   - Minimum Keys: 46,865
   - Maximum Keys: 46,884
   - Variance: 19 keys (0.04%)
   - Even distribution at 1.6% per consumer

3. **System Stability**
   - Zero duplicate processing
   - No message loss
   - Clean termination
   - Consistent processing rate

## Conclusions

The system successfully demonstrated:
1. Perfect exactly-once processing for 3M keys
2. Excellent load balancing across 64 consumers
3. Stable performance under high load
4. Resilience against race conditions
5. Efficient resource utilization

The implementation proves to be a reliable solution for handling large-scale key expiration events in Redis, with potential applications in:
- Cache invalidation systems
- Time-based event processing
- Distributed job scheduling
- Event-driven architectures
